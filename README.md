CocoaPods' "Chillax, Swift" Plugin
==================================

A CocoaPods plugin to disable all compiler optimizations for specific pods.

Why?
----

So you're writing a hit new app and need an external dependency. The library you want to use is available as a CocoaPod â€“ awesome! But it's written in Swift. Good thing CocoaPods 0.36 Beta 1 version support Swift pods! Using the beta version of CocoaPods, you install the library, try to compile, then BAM the compiler segfaults.

```

This problem is often caused by the Swift compiler's opimizations. Disabling them fixes the segfault.

Doncha wish that you could just tell Swift to Chillax? Well, now you can. 

How?
----

This plugin requires version 0.36 Beta 1 of CocoaPods. Create or modify a file named `Gemfile` in the root of your project's directory:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'cocoapods', :git => 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods.git', :tag => '0.36.0.beta.1'
gem 'cocoapods-chillax-swift', '~> 0.2.0'
```

Great! Now from the command line in the same directory as the `Gemfile`, run `bundle install` to install both the pre-release version of CocoaPods and this plugin. You've installed the plugin, but you still need to tell CocoaPods which pods are segfaulting the compiler. Open your Podfile and add the following lines. 

```ruby
plugin 'cocoapods-chillax-swift', {
  :pods => ['XCGLogger']
}
```

In this example, we're disabling compiler optimizations for [XCGLogger](https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger). 

*Important*: from now on, instead of typing `pod install`, you *must* type `bundle exec pod install`. If you don't, then you're running the version of CocoaPods installed for the entire system instead of the version specified in the `Gemfile`. 

OK, next time you `bundle exec pod install`, you'll get a little extra message at the end of the process. 

```
> bundle exec pod install

And you're good to go!
